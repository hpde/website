<h3>Version 1.2 of the HP Data Policy released, 4 October 2016</h3>
<p>
The <a target="_blank" href="doc/Heliophysics_Data_Policy_v1.2_2016Oct04.html">NASA Heliophysics Science Data Management Policy</a> has been revised somewhat, and the new version has been released.  One significant change is to deemphasize VxOs in favor of a more unified approach based on standards for data and metadata rather than on particular portals.  Resident Archives may no longer be necessary since data are flowing to Final Archives on a regular basis, so these are also deemphasized.  Standard data formats (principally FITS, CDF, and NetCDF) are now stated as prescribed; exceptions to this would need strong justification.  The intent of these changes is to more deeply unify the HPDE, thus making new and deeper scientific insights much easier to achieve.

<h3>New Heliophysics Guide to Software Tools Initiated, May 2013</h3>
<p>
The "Software Tools" link above provides an initial effort to answer the call in the NRC Decadal Report for more Heliophysics access to software tools.  The initial entries provide help with some standard formats, and pointers (with help) to some very useful software, much of it in IDL.  The plan is to systematically expand this guide with input from the community.

<h3>Data Center Senior Review Released, April 2010</h3>
<p>
The Heliophysics Data Centers (HDMC, SPDF, and SDAC) were reviewed along with the NSSDC by a Senior Review Panel in July of 2009.  The <a target="_blank" href="doc/HDMC_SR_Final_15_June_2009nb.pdf"> HDMC Proposal to the Senior Review</a> outlined a plan to complete the description of a comprehensive set of HP resources, continue Virtual Observatories as part of the HPDE infrastructure, provide Resident Archives to maintain mission data access after the mission is done, and upgrade existing HP data resources.  The <a target="_blank" href= "doc/SR2009_Helio_Data_Archives_FINAL.pdf"> Report of the Data Centers Senior Review Panel</a> basically agreed with the main points of the HDMC proposal, while making suggestions about the overall HPDE architecture.  A brief <a target="_blank" href= "doc/Reply_to_Data_SR_2009_.pdf"> reply to the Report from the Data Centers </a> in large measure accepted the Report's findings, but clarified some points that were seemingly not well communicated in the proposals.  Based on the Panel report, NASA HQ has instructed the Data Centers to proceed with their plans.  There will be ongoing assessment of possible HPDE improvements based on the Senior Review and other input.

<h3>New NRA Results Available, February 2010</h3>
<p>
The ROSES 2009 NRA call for Heliophysics Data Environment Enhancements (HDEE), which included a call for Data Upgrades, Resident Archives, and Value added services, did not include a call for new VxOs, as it had in the past, as all major areas were already covered.  The abstracts of the resulting <a target="_blank" href="doc/HDEE09_Selections.pdf">selected tasks</a> are now available. The main emphasis was on Data Upgrades and Resident Archives, although a couple of Value Added service proposals were funded.      
</p>
<hr aligh="center">
<h3>New Version of Data Policy Released 12 April 2009</h3>
<p>
The draft changes of the Data Policy were extensively reviewed by the Heliophysics Data and Computing Working Group and a number of other community members.  The draft was advertised for comment in community newsletters, as well as in an AGU talk.  The <a target="_blank" href="doc/Heliophysics_Data_Policy_2009Apr12.html">resulting document</a> <a href="doc/Heliophysics_Data_Policy_2009Apr12.pdf"> (pdf version)</a> is now available.  
</p>
<hr align="center">
<h3>New Draft Data Policy Released for Comment, 4 November 2008</h3>
<p>
The HP Data Policy as originally released lacked details such as what would become of VxOs after their initial funding period and it was vague about the nature of Final Archives and their relationship to Mission and Resident Archives.  A draft of the Data Policy that contains answers to these concerns was made available for comment.  Of particular importance were Appendix F that defines HP archives, and Appendix G that is the charter for the HDMC.  Most of the other changes in the document are related to the ideas in these appendices.

<h3>Heliophysics Data and Model Consortium (HDMC) kickoff meeting, 10-12 June 2008</h3>
<p>
The VOs, RAs, and related data projects have a new umbrella
organization, the HDMC, that will be responsible for the cross-mission
and post-mission serving of HP data. The Implementation
Working Group, consisting of representatives of all the constituent
groups, had an initial, formative meeting on 10-12 June at UMBC in
Baltimore, MD. Each of the VxOs presented their visions and
plans, and there was discussion of topics of mutual interest, including
SPASE registries, a possible SPASE Query Language, and the role of
Resident and other Archives. The idea of the HDMC is
endorsed by the HP Data and Computing Working Group, and this meeting
brought general acceptance by the participants. Many of the
presentations from the meeting can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://sites.google.com/site/hdmctalks/Home/list-of-talks">here</a>.

<h3>Results of NRA for VxOs, Services, RAs, and Data Upgrades published, June 2008</h3>
<p>
The selections based on the 2007 NASA ROSES call for proposals are now
finalized. There was one addition to the VxOs, the Virtual Wave
Observatory (VWO), which will be closely associated with VHO, and the
Virtual Model Repository (VMR) was given regular funding. There were
five
proposals for value-added services funded, notably one to help manage
event lists and one to include auroral image data in a "VO" that unites
ground-based magnetometer stations. In addition, there were five
proposals accepted for
Data Service Upgrades to improve the utility and accessibility of
various particular data products. New this year, six Resident Archive
proposals were accepted, for missions including Yohkoh, SOHO, POLAR, TRACE,
and SNOE. &nbsp;Read the <a target="_blank" href="doc/Abstracts_Accepted_VxO_2007_ROSES.html">complete set
of abstracts of winning awards</a>.

<hr align="center">
<h3> The next round of VxO, Service, and Data Upgrades selected for the NASA HP VxO program, July 2007</h3>
<p>
The previous round of VxO selections are now all funded, and the
competition based on the 2006 NASA ROSES call for proposals is now
complete. There were two additions to the VxOs, the Virtual Energetic Particle
Observatory (VEPO), which will be closely associated with VHO, and the
Virtual Model Repository (VMR) which will begin to explore how modeling
will be incorporated into the VO architecture. There were two
proposals for value-added services that were funded, one for an
enhancement to VSO and the other to develop what is needed for uniform
access to the parameters in files for the use of tools that can span
products easily. In addition, there were nine proposals accepted for
Data Service Upgrades to improve the utility and accessibility of
various particular data products. Read the <a target="_blank" href="doc/Abstracts_Accepted_VxO_2006_ROSES.html">complete set
of abstracts of winning awards</a>.

<h3>VO, SPASE workshops held, June/July 2007</h3>
<p>
A workshop was held 12-15 June 2007 that involved a very broad
discussion of the issues involved in "Virtual Observatories in
Geophysics" <a target="_blank" href="http://www.egy.org/VOiG/">VOiG</a>.
On 11 June, the NASA VxOs (and friends including GAIA and VSTO) met to
exchange status reports and to further discussions of cross-VxO issues.
</p>
<p>
A <a target="_blank" href="http://cdhf5.bnsc.rl.ac.uk/spase_meeting.html">meeting
of the SPASE group</a> was held in Abingdon, UK on 9-11 July
2007. It advanced the SPASE Data Model considerably. As a result of the
meeting, the Resource Types of Software, Document, Service, and Model
will be worked on by various subgroups and eventually added to the
model. There was considerable discussion of the great importance of and
the possibilities for international collaboration, and this will be a
continuing theme. Presentations from the SPASE meeting can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://www.spase-group.org/meetings/Jul2007/">here</a>.

<h3>NASA selects new discipline specific Virtual Observatories (VxO's); <br>
Kickoff and related meetings held, May 2006</h3>
<p>
The next phase of NASA's Heliophysics Data Environment has begun with
the selection of a set of five (mostly new) VxOs to add to the
established Virtual Solar Observatory. A number of small projects were
also selected to provide data service upgrades for specific datasets.
The three year VxO projects are the: <a target="_blank" href="http://vho.nasa.gov/">Virtual
Heliospheric Observatory</a> (VHO, Adam Szabo, PI); <a target="_blank" href="http://vmo.nasa.gov/"> Virtual Magnetospheric
Observatory</a> (VMO, Jan Merka, PI); <a target="_blank" href="http://vmo.igpp.ucla.edu/"> Virtual Magnetospheric
Observatory</a> (a second VMO, Raymond Walker, PI); <a target="_blank" href="http://virbo.org/"> Virtual Radiation Belt Observatory</a>
(ViRBO, Robert Weigel, PI); and <a target="_blank" href="http://vitmo.jhuapl.edu/">Virtual
Ionosphere, Thermosphere, Mesosphere Observatory</a> (VITMO,
Daniel Morrison, PI). This set of VxOs, along with various ongoing
efforts (see the Data Access link above) and collaborations with other
agencies and countries, will bring us to the next level of realization
of the plans outlined in the Workshop discussed below.
</p>
<p>
Read the <a target="_blank" href="doc/VxO_05_Selections.pdf"> complete set of
winning proposal abstracts</a> for both the VxOs and the data
service upgrades.
</p>
<p>
A kickoff meeting was held on 22 May 2006 in Baltimore that involved
the new VxOs along with the more established VSO, VSPO, GAIA, CoSEC,
and SPDF (see below for information and and links). The <a target="_blank" href="doc/vo_kickoff_22_May_06_papers.html">agenda and
presentations</a> from that meeting are all available.
</p>
<p>
At the AGU meeting following the kickoff meeting, a special session was
held on "The Science Needs for the Data Environment of the Great
Observatory" and <a target="_blank" href="doc/AGU_GO_Science_May_06_papers.html">many
papers from this session</a> are available that should help VxO
designers in their work. Also, the Friday of the VxO kickoff week, a
workshop was held on the use of "Ontologies" to capture and use the
meaning and relationships of the terms used in Earth and Space Science.
A <a target="_blank" href="http://sras.jhuapl.edu/workshop.html"> summary
with links to papers</a> is now online.

<h3>Space and Solar Physics Virtual Observatories Workshop, October 2004</h3>
<p>
To help the space and solar physics
community arrive at a clear plan for its data environment, NASA's
Living With a Star Program sponsored a multi-agency, international
workshop on <b> October 27-29, 2004 at the Marriott Hotel in
Greenbelt, MD.</b> The idea of this workshop was endorsed by the
Virtual Observatories Birds-of-a-Feather meeting at the Fall 2003 AGU
meeting, and by NASA's Sun-Earth Connection Data and Computing Working
Group. About 100 people attended, representing many of the major
efforts within space and solar physics as well as related Earth Science
and Astronomy groups.
</p>
<p>
Read the <a target="_blank" href="doc/VO_Technical_Meeting_2004.html">complete first announcement.</a> Most of the time was spent in focus
and plenary working groups, but there were invited presentations, and
many posters which were up for the whole meeting. A near final <a target="_blank" href="doc/VO_Workshop_Agenda3.html">agenda and suggestions for
the focus groups</a> is still available.
